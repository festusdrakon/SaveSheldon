# SaveSheldon

tldr? A text classifier that detects sarcasm.

As is well known to fams and fans of The Big Bang Theory, Sheldon Cooper, one the most brilliant minds of 21st century American Entertainment, sadly struggles to detect sarcasm in casual conversation. So a bunch of Cool Women in Tech decided to partner up and solve this pressing problem in modern pop culture. 

In this repo we document this journey for the reference of techies undertaking a similar quest in the near or far future! We hope you enjoy the process as much as we did, as hope to make it easier for you to follow along! ^_^
